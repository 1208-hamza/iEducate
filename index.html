                Educational reforms are the need of the hour…
                <br>
                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
                <br>
                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
